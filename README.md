# Python-Superpermutation
A Python implementation of finding the "shortest" (could only do Î£ (n-i)!, i = 0, 1, .., n long) superpermutation of n objects. A superpermutation of n objects is a string that have all of the permutations of that objects.

Example of superpermutations:

superpermutation of 2 objects : 212 (length = 3)

superpermutation of 3 objects : 123121321 (length = 9)

superpermutation of 4 objects : 124312413241234121432142314213421 (length = 33)

and so on ...

to run : python PSuperpermute.py <number_of_object(s)>
